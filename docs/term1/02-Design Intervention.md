## Deform your face

We’ve designed a collective Design Intervention to explore how alterations of your face can change your perception of yourself; either hide a part of you or enhance it. We want to give the possibility of changing your face to a specific group of people, and allow them to reflect on reconfiguration of the body. This change they can apply to their faces; might be on purpose to hide a part they don’t like or either enhance another one they love.

The intervention took place on my birthday party with friends. We believe that the relaxed atmosphere of this type of space gives the participant more room to get carried away.

Our intervention wants to explore the following questions:

- Did you choose to alter your face to hide or change a part of yourself you don’t like? Or to enhance your existing identity?
- After changing your face, do you feel more like yourself or less like yourself?

After getting all the answers and having the majority of people choosing features that they identify with, enhancing their owns, we can reflect that the ability of change can reinforce one’s identity, impacting in areas like confidence, self-image and self-awareness.
