# Design With Others

These are some of the pinpoints that stood up for me during Design with Others seminar:
-	Understanding design as a political practice

-	Questioning our role designing in complex assemblages:

Assemblages are composed of heterogeneous elements or objects that enter into relations with one another.
These objects are not all of the same type. 
Thus, you have physical objects, happenings, events, and so on, but you also have signs, utterances, and so on. While there are assemblages that are composed entirely of bodies, there are no assemblages composed entirely of signs and utterances.

-	Effectively integrating affected parties in design projects:

Active listening is a good practice for better understanding affected parties’ problems. It takes time, attention and care.

-	Sustain system's level intervening over long periods of time 

### It is important to acknowledge some of the limitations we face:

-	Real understanding requires bodily involvement

-	Deep change takes time

-	Meaningful connection requires attention and care

-	Impact requires practice

### Transitional Design

Transition Design is a transdisciplinary approach aimed at addressing the many ‘wicked’ problems confronting 21st century societies: climate change, forced migration, political and social polarization, global pandemics, lack of access to affordable housing/healthcare/education and many others. These problems are interconnected, interdependent and always manifest in place and culture-specific ways.

- Wicked problems are at the root of many seemingly ‘simple’ problems we encounter at the level of our everyday lives (work, home, recreation, etc.) Transitional Design argues that solving for higher-level, wicked problems will have a trickle-down effect, solving for multiple problems simultaneously.

- Wicked problems must be framed within radically large, spatio-temporal contexts from the distant past (to understand how the problem evolved) into the long-term future (what we want to transition toward).
### ...ALWAYS QUESTION THE SYSTEMS

# SOIL OBSERVATIONS AROUND THE SANS AREA.

In this seminar we focused on the subjects of land and soil. 

We went outside and observed moments where we could find friction or conflict between bodies and happenings revolving on the concept of soil.

Personally, I observed how bare soil and for thus vegetation is being marginalized and undervalued around the Sans area. I can understand that Sans urban configuration is rapidly changing, with many construction taking place, but this marginalization can be a reflection of what happens in Barcelona’s and most of the modern cities’ urban infrastructure. 

Soil is cleared and converted into inert material surfaces such as roads, sidewalks and buildings. And when vegetation is included, it takes very constrained spaces only for tree planting, leaving many of the native medium and small size flora like bushes out of the urban panorama, and in many cases, these spaces are used by people as secondary garbage collectors.
