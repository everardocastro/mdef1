# PULSE

Beign fascinated by the idea of tapping into the subtle conversations within the botanical world, we have embarked on a journey to understand the complex signals emanated from plants detected by the ECG sensor. The project holds promising potential for unlocking profound insights into plant communication and behavior. Understanding these signals could lead to innovative applications, such as enhanced agricultural practices, environmental monitoring, and possibly even fostering more meaningful connections between humans and the botanical world. The project's future success could mark a significant leap forward in our comprehension of nature's intricate language, offering opportunities for sustainable advancements and deeper engagement with the plant kingdom.

The signals emitted by plants to communicate with each other and with the environment can be of different natures. Some plants use chemical signals such as VOCs (volatile organic compounds) in response to herbivore or pathogen attacks, others may emit root exudates to inhibit the growth of competitors. The ability of plants to exchange signals, water and nutrients through mycorrhizal networks is also well known. During this intervention, we used a multi-sensor device such as the Smart Citizen Kit to capture and analyze how certain chemical parameters varied in response to different situations. The goal is to make these interactions apparent and over time try to understand a little better how these chemical signals work and what they respond to.
