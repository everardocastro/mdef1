# Biology Zero

## Reflection

Nuria Conde y Jonathan Minchin
Bio zero was a very interesting topic for me, I’ve always been interested in biology and in understanding how life and matter work. 

Getting to know the modern history of biology and focus on genetics has been helpful to understand the possibilities and our capabilities as human species. 

Something that stuck on my mind is that if you want to understand something you need to be able to build it. 
To carry out experiments using bacteria ourselves and to see microorganisms with the instruments was for sure a first-hand experience that allows me to feel more comfortable on working on them again in the near future. 

## Remarks

### Scientific Method

- Ask ONE question

- Do Background research

- Construct One Hypothesis

- Don’t attack more than ONE question

- USE as many CONTROLS as possible

- PAY attention to it

- You need proteins to do things… protein data base.
