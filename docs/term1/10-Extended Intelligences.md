# Extended Intelligences

## GENERAL VIEW ON AI

This course is my first introduction to the AI world in a more technical and practical way. I have used AI tools in the past but I always wondered how these systems really work; It seemed to me a bit mysterious and magical, but in reality, AI means to automate through statistics. I feel that having had access to this course information now I can view AI in a more analytical and critical way. I feel that now I have a perspective that can imagine how this tool can be of use and how it can feed my research.

Personally, it is exciting to know the potential of this tool, especially in the fields of arts, digital fabrication, and economization of time and work. But it was also very eye opening to me getting to know the dark side of AI, regarding environmental implications, as well as the bias on its interpretations, which can also be reflected on the human generated databases that feed them. 

As AI takes a more important role in our lives, how can we reduce its carbon footprint? How is it going to affect our cognitive view of the world and ourselves (if its not already happening)? How can we make sure that this tool doesnâ€™t become something else in the world that divides us and marginalizes? 

## LOVER HACKER

Lover Hacker was a critic on how AI take on tasks that are very human as identifying emotions and specially some of the most mysterious: love and flirting behavior. 

Having a machine interpret and declare our emotions by our facial expression seems something a bit off. As we humans become more and more dependent on machines, are we going to also digitalize love? This is not very far from reality as dating apps are already a big player on love and sexual relationships. 

The Lover Hacker makes us reflect that emotions are a very complex human condition to read digitally and even among us, as they depend on many factors, including not only facial expressions but also body language, verbal communication, cultural context and situation. 
On the helpful side, we can only suggest with not much certainty that an accurate and very well-trained emotional detection can help people with conditions such as blindness or emotional processing challenges such as Asperger.
