### Reflection

This project was a crazy challenge. It has electronics, hardware adaptations, sensors, soft robot, and it hosts living organisms. Looking back, I am impressed on the outcome in the short time we had to develop it. One of the most impressed outcomes I had from this challenge is that you have to try things to allow them to fail and quickly come up with solutions. This challenge demanded our creativity on full, and cooperation as a group.

In a group work it is important to divide the work and to be concious of what everybody tasks is. In this case, some were focused on the electronics, some others on ,he hardare, others on the software, etc. but of course if its necessary, we can trespass these frontiers and help each other when needed. 

Personally this was a very fun time creatingwith friends. It also opened up future ideas to further develop the project, which eventually ended up as part of an exhibibion in Cesenatico Italia!
And one more important lesson, be carefull with electronics and water. Good thing we covered the mother board and most of the electronics in a vacummed plastic. For the challenge there was no problem. But eventually was meant to happen one day, happened one day before our exhibition in itally, we had a leak of water into one of the computers which resulted on it no longer working. 
Expect and prepare for the worse my friends. But have fun and never loose hope ðŸ˜‰
