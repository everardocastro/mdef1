## Reflection:

As this was a group task and we were six members it was hard to come up with a topic in common at the beginning. Even though we have different approaches and lots of ideas, we all wanted to tackle issues tied with the city and how we move in it. At the end we managed to work in a project that interests us all: How we move in the city in a healthier way, considering the specific topics of sunlight and light pollution.

In general, this seminar unlocked a door for me: having access to data doesn’t have to be a hard thing to achieve and it doesn’t have to be in a singular way. There are different ways to measure one same thing, from the instruments to the observables. 
Another very useful process to know about, was how to access data bases with AI, and how to translate them to tables and visuals in order to feed our research.
