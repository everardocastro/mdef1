### Fructification Workshop and Conversation with Enclave Micopirata Mutante

I decided to join the workshop as the topic of fungal fructification is unknown to me. It was interesting to learn about different fructification processes of the mycelium. Learning from substrates, different species and conditions. At the end of the session, we dedicated some time to take part on the “Mycelium Liberation Front”, which aim is to “liberate” lab experiments in the natural ecosystem. 

I decided to bring with me one of my mycelium-clay experiments that I developed for the design dialogues as a medium to discuss about mycelium practices, deepen knowledge on this specific technique (mycelium growing on and in clay) and its possible future to create structures that are able to fructify, and at the end of the workshop, to liberate it in the nearest green area. 

After presenting the experiment and ask questions the conversation was triggered, and I could learn from the Enclave Micopirata Mutante that clay minerals have been proved to have antimicrobial and antifungal properties, unless it has sufficient nutrients to enable fungal growth. We talked about several recipes that could be fructifying in clay as well as techniques to enable respiration in the clay body. 
We talked about clay and ceramics. How the process of working with one or another is relevant in order to define one’s relationship with the material, or the living organism in the case of mycelium.

Another que I had was to know their perspective on using mycelium as a material. Some people are against of this approach as it is seen as manipulating a living being in order to kill it and produce a polymer that serve humans. The question triggered a long and interesting conversation with different points of view:

-	For some of the participants it is okay to work with mycelium as a material depending on the end use. It is more ethically correct to use it as a plastic substitute or animal leather substitute, rather than for other proposes. This also made us think on how we view eating animals and using wood as a material, which to me personally is something similar, as we grow plants in order to use their wood and fibers.

-	Made us think on how working with mycelium in the lab, involves the use of lots of plastics from gloves to petri dishes, plastic bags, boxes and foil. At the end the expression of “it is okay to use it as a plastic substitute” becomes contradictory with the laboratory process.

-	Depends on the relationship one has with mycelium. If it is a reciprocal relationship, where one gives nutrients in order to receive something, especially better if its food (mushrooms) rather than a material. 

-	At the end, the conversation made us question where does the human manipulation start, or where does it become damaging for the organism.

-	Is it okay to work with it in a laboratory, controlling its conditions and development as long as the end use is not to obtain a material? Is it okay to do this as long as we tackle the plastic problem or for food production? Can mycelium become a “material giver” such as trees and other plants with wood and fibers? How can mycelium cultivation and harvesting become more “respectful”? How can human and fungal relationship can be deepened? 
I extrapolate it with my clay practice in order to create ceramic pieces, where I am conscious of the material origin, the time it takes to process to be useful for modeling a piece, the physical contact and manipulation with my body, the process to wood fire it. I see a difference with industrial clay and electrical kiln. Not to be purist but because of the level of relationship with the material on its different stages. 
Book… humans are the bridge between the cosmos and the material
