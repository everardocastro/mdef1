# Work in progress, stay tuned...

Transformation of matter through passive energy sources and earthbound processes. Motivated by exploring and proposing alternative methods of production that respond to the current context of hyperextractivism on a planetary scale. Inspired by the merge between high tech, low tech and handcrafts it seeks the connection between the traditional and the new methods of fabrication, aspiring for new interpretations of forms and aesthetics. ultimately it looks to redefine of our relationship with materials and the act of making on this anthropocene context.

### Purpose

- to generate curiosity and raise awareness providing alternative paths on the making process that are more in tuned with the planet we are.

### How 

- sharing the process and being transparent with what is being produced. also trhough artistic instalations and products that focus on the idea of connection, transformation and simbiosis with the planet we are.
- Involving others in the process. meaning other disciplines, artists and other people in general depending on the specific project´s nature and goal.

### Why

returning to an idealized past (holocene) is not an option. We must think new ways of living in the anthropocene.  if our intention is to survive as a species on Earth we must rethink the modernist mostly western project of separating nature and culture. This involves rethinking our manufacturing processes and material world, and in doing so, rethinking the relationship we have with materials, energy harvesting and non human agents involved (living and non living).

## PRINCIPLES:

### To be resourceful

- The goal is to manufacture with whats around, we use and transform our organic and inorganic waste, using the space, energy source, and tools we have available locally.
- Passive energy sources, technologies and methods:
    - Microorganisms power of degradation and transformation, and as a result of bioprocesses, biopolymer generation (mycelium based materials and bacterial cellulose).
    - Harvesting solar energy to obtain electricity and heat.

### Merging digital fabrication and traditional handcrafts

- Contemporary digital fabrication methods could enable the generation of complex geometries and material configurations.
- The introduction of handcraft techniques enable a closer encounter with the material, allowing better understanding of its properties and expanding possibilities for manipulation and results.
- The hole process could begin in a digital way with a handcrafted postprocessing and viceversa, or both at the same time.

### Transparency and education.

- Share the process through digital platforms.
- Material, energy and process literacy.
- Organize workshops to try resourcefulness, new passive tools and explore our relationship with materials and the agents involved.

## Projects in course

- Solar heat harvesting device that could be used for surface modification, such as engraving, material melting and fusion.
- Experiments with micelium and clay are being developed to possibly increment the resistance of unfired clay. In another scenario, after drying the clay-mycelium matrix, the clay body is rinsed off leaving only the “mycelium crust” due to its higher hydrophobic property. This process could be used for art purposes, functional objects, mycotextile production and mold making that are alternative to plastic molds.
