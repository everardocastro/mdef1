### Designing with what is around. Alternatives in materials, artifacts and spaces, incorporating passive technologies and the concept of resourcefulness.

No, this is not an attempt to go back and reject new technologies. Instead **otroterrestre** looks for merging them with passive methods and a concious source of energy and materials. 

This project seeks to **merge alchemy, technology, handcrafts and the concept of resourcefulness in materials and energy**, in order to generate new processes of making within our planetary boundaries.

**otroterrestre** believes that the possibility of energetic independence and economical relief through being resourceful and adopting passive methods can be a motivator for change on a bigger scale.

**otroterrestre** is based on the concept of **deriving pleasure from scarcity**, collaborating with others to craft items that promote wellness by becoming productive instruments of pleasure e.g. by heating, cooking, or manufacturing. 


### Why

Returning to an idealized past (holocene) is not an option. We must think new ways of living in the anthropocene.  if our intention is to survive as a species on Earth we must rethink the modernist mostly western project of separating nature and culture. This involves rethinking our manufacturing processes and material world, and in doing so, rethinking the relationship we have with materials, energy harvesting and non human agents involved (living and non living, for example microorganisms or the sun).

Techologycal comodity bubble has in a way made ourselfs distant from our surroundings. We rely mostly on electricity driven aparatus that modify our materials and our environment. The fastness of availability gives us the illusion that resources are limitless taking us further away from the natural processes and the idea of being resourceful with what we have around. 

We will need to be more conscious and inventive with materials around us. We need to come back to a point where things are being reused, repurposed, grown or not produced in the first place.

What is required are optimistic strategies for change, actions driven by joy and pleasure, leading to a reduction feelings like paralyzing anxiety, fear, and guilt. 


### Questions that we seek to respond:

How to redefine our relationships…

**between human and non human agents** through the process of creating and our creations?

**with the materials and processes involved in making** consciously?

**how to become earthbound** in this confusing existance? not meaning going back to primitive, but adapting and navigating the changes brought by the **anthropocene** in accordance to the planet we are?

### PURPOSE

- To redefine the relationships with materials and our ecological surroundings with the aim to bring us closer to our nature.
- To challenge the conventional notions of production and living in the Anthropocene era. By promoting alternative making processes and emphasizing the interconnectedness between nature and culture, it seeks to inspire a shift away from the modernist mindset towards a more symbiotic relationship with our planet.
- To inspire a change of perspective, providing alternative paths on the making process that are more in tuned with the planet we are.

### PRINCIPLES:

**Pay attention to situated geographical and social context**

- It is important to consider the natural conditions of the place such as weather, availability of materials, seasonal changes.
- It is also important to pay attention to the social condition of the place and be careful on the interactions with the community.

**To be resourceful**

- The goal is to manufacture with whats around, we use and transform our organic and inorganic waste, using the space, energy source, and tools we have available locally.
- DIY-DIT, Opensource Methodology.

*Incorporate passive methods, low tech and high tech:

- Microorganisms power of degradation and transformation, and as a result of some bioprocesses, “material” growth (mycelium based materials and bacterial cellulose).
- Harvesting solar, wind and kinetick energy for electricity, light and heat.
- See potential in what new technologies can offer, hacking them if necessary to function in a more symbiotic manner with our ecological surroundings.

**Merging digital fabrication and traditional handcrafts.**

- Contemporary digital fabrication methods could enable the generation of complex geometries and material configurations.
- The introduction of handcraft techniques enable a closer encounter with the material, allowing better understanding of its properties and expanding possibilities for manipulation and results.

**Pay attention to scale and relationships**

- We relate with non human agents on symbiotic systems and or materials on a thoughtfull scale and manner.

**Find pleasure in scarcity**

- Trhough collaborative process (with human and non human communities) we can generate a collective spirit of pleasure in scarcity, with objects and process that satisfy our needs and desires, and therefore find value and see abundance in what we have around.

**Transparency and education**

- Share the process through digital platforms. Material, energy and process literacy.
- Art as a translator of concepts.
- Organize workshops to design new passive tools, experiment the concept of resourcefulness and explore our relationship with materials and the agents involved.

### Projects in course:

- Passive material modification. Solar heat harvesting device that could be used for surface modification, such as engraving, material melting and fusion for material experimentation.
- Experiments with micelium and clay are being developed to possibly increment the resistance of unfired clay. In another scenario, after drying the clay-mycelium matrix, the clay body is rinsed off leaving only the “mycelium crust” due to its higher hydrophobic property. This process could be used for art pieces, functional objects, mycotextile production and mold making that are alternative to plastic molds.
- Speculating on applying the projects principles in architecture…
