I have the fortune to have lived, work and visit various parts of my country. I am deeply in love of its rawness, people and knowledge. I studied the Bachelor of Architecture at Universidad de Monterrey (UDEM), did an exchange program at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) and have worked in Tulum, and Sinaloa as an architect, as well as developing my growing interest in experimentation with matter and making objects. </p> <p>I am very interested in working alongside nature to generate materials and new ways of experiencing spaces and objects, and therefore change our perspective of how we view our world. Currently I am developing a project where I design and create functional and sculptural objects made from wild clay that I collect, process, hand build and then wood fire myself in my pit fire kiln. I\u2019ve also been experimenting with bacterial cellulose and fungi, and I am very excited by the possibilities of these and many more materials.</p> <p>Ultimately my vision of the future is a place where our activities and creations, whether it is an object, a living space or a city, or even software and hardware do not alienize us from our planet, but bring us much closer to our nature, allowing humans and the other species to thrive in this interconnected world. I am very excited about the making possibilities of MDEF and the exchange of knowledge between people from different disciplines and parts of the world, and I am also very keen on getting my hands dirty!</p> <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit my website</p>"},{"location":"project/project/","title":"Initial ideas","text":"<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

The prototype is the process itself and not the final product. The process is documented and analyzed in order to see why the results came up the way they did.

Jorge had the idea to create a device that you could plug into your phone and work as a controller when making music with an instrument, eliminating the need for cables and sound mixer and increasing the accecibility in making music. </p> <p>This is a prototype I made to exemplify the idea of making music even more accessible by using your body as an instrument. The idea is you wear this device that can sensor your movements, rhythm and brain waves and translate them into sounds. It can also be used with your voice; you could sing a melody and it translates it in a selected instrument\u2019s chords. </p> <p> movement</p> <p> voice</p>"},{"location":"term1/02-Design%20Studio/#my-toolbox","title":"My toolbox","text":""},{"location":"term1/03-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/","title":"Atlas of Weak Signals","text":""},{"location":"term1/03-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>In this seminar we tried to identify our weak signals which are these indicators of possible change and impact on the future. We tried to identify our own atlas of weak signals based on our own interests and abilities on the present, but trying to imagine how they can be developed into further more elaborated ideas and possible projects for change in the future.</p> <p>It is worth mention the importance of the adoption of 1<sup>st</sup> person perspective in order to tackle big problems like for example climate change, as it can help us break them down into smaller actions that are more reachable to us and our community.

A Design Space is a visual map of ideas that sparks reflection and creates connection between concepts, references, materials, workspaces, technologies and possible contexts of intervention. Its goal is to be a tool that brings awareness to unconscious experiences, values and attitudes as designers in order to reflect about our practice and help us better understand our interests and potential of action.</p> <p>We start by placing all of these concepts and physical components as materials and workspaces in a multiscalar map that allows as to see where we are standing and what tools are in our reach to the be able and represent the potential connections in a personal design space.</p> <p></p> <p></p>"},{"location":"term1/03-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#reflection","title":"Reflection","text":"<p>This exercise was more difficult than I thought it would be, as I think I have many different interests, putting my brain in a visual workspace was a bit confusing but at the same time super reflective and helpful. I think I\u2019ve never been able to process all my ideas and interests to be able to see a path or connection between them until now. I realize how much some of these concepts relate with each other, and the realm of possibilities for change that can come out of them.</p> <p>I also realize how many opportunities I have around me, how many actions can be made through different spaces like iaac fablab elisava , the P oblenou spaces and also the power of community and collaboration.</p> <p>I know my design space is not as clear at the moment, and that it will mutate with time, knowledge and experience, but now I see myself reflected and I have my intention and purpose more clear.</p>"},{"location":"term1/04-Documenting%20Design/","title":"Documenting Design","text":"<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
