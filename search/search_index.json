I have the fortune to have lived, work and visit various parts of my country. I am deeply in love of its rawness, people and knowledge. I studied the Bachelor of Architecture at Universidad de Monterrey (UDEM), did an exchange program at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) and have worked in Tulum, and Sinaloa as an architect, as well as developing my growing interest in experimentation with matter and making objects. </p> <p>I am very interested in working alongside nature to generate materials and new ways of experiencing spaces and objects, and therefore change our perspective of how we view our world. Currently I am developing a project where I design and create functional and sculptural objects made from wild clay that I collect, process, hand build and then wood fire myself in my pit fire kiln. I\u2019ve also been experimenting with bacterial cellulose and fungi, and I am very excited by the possibilities of these and many more materials.</p> <p>Ultimately my vision of the future is a place where our activities and creations, whether it is an object, a living space or a city, or even software and hardware do not alienize us from our planet, but bring us much closer to our nature, allowing humans and the other species to thrive in this interconnected world. I am very excited about the making possibilities of MDEF and the exchange of knowledge between people from different disciplines and parts of the world, and I am also very keen on getting my hands dirty!</p>"},{"location":"project/project/","title":"Initial ideas","text":"<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

I brought a picture of an earthenware vessel I hand built and wood fired in my adobe kiln back in Mexico.

A Design Space is a visual map of ideas that sparks reflection and creates connection between concepts, references, materials, workspaces, technologies and possible contexts of intervention. Its goal is to be a tool that brings awareness to unconscious experiences, values and attitudes as designers in order to reflect about our practice and help us better understand our interests and potential of action.</p> <p>We start by placing all of these concepts and physical components as materials and workspaces in a multiscalar map that allows as to see where we are standing and what tools are in our reach to the be able and represent the potential connections in a personal design space.</p> <p></p> <p></p>"},{"location":"term1/03-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#reflection","title":"Reflection","text":"<p>This exercise was more difficult than I thought it would be, as I think I have many different interests, putting my brain in a visual workspace was a bit confusing but at the same time super reflective and helpful.

He showed us different styles of practicing documentation. This was very helpful because everyone has a different way of communicating and understanding the subject. For some, visual representation is more useful, for others, words come out more easily, to put some examples. </p> <p>I think one of the most relevant point that was remarked was the importance of documenting itself. Documenting is very useful to have a record of a process and to keep track of the steps that were taken in order for the result could be accomplished. It is also very relevant to document the failures, as they are equally, if not more important for lesson learning and direction taking. </p> <p>In my experience documenting has been very useful but has also been a challenge. I have to get used to the idea of keeping record of my work, as well as being organized and clear at the moment of presenting it on a platform. The biggest challenge has been the developing of my own website, using mkdocs and Github without ever hearing about them before.  I also have to admit that this exercise has been very enriching and fulfilling.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"term1/05-The%20Machine%20Paradox/","title":"Documenting Design","text":"<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

When I woke up I had a hard time to get up because my room was totally dark. When I finally got up I had the idea to get a sun bath outside and it really made the difference. It allowed me to be more awake and energized.</p> <p>I had some observations like how candle lights can give a cozier ambient and how their intensity and tone of light does not interfere with the production of melatonin, the hormone that helps us to relax our body and fall asleep. Talking with my roommates in our candle lighten living I could notice how our conversations deepened and even our voice tones became more neutral, it almost felt like when you have a dreamy talk (when you are half asleep and half awake).
