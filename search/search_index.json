Currently I am developing a project where I design and create functional and sculptural objects made from wild clay that I collect, process, hand build and then wood fire myself in my pit fire kiln. I\u2019ve also been experimenting with bacterial cellulose and fungi, and I am very excited by the possibilities of these and many more materials.</p> <p>Ultimately my vision of the future is a place where our activities and creations, whether it is an object, a living space or a city, or even software and hardware do not alienize us from our planet, but bring us much closer to our nature, allowing humans and the other species to thrive in this interconnected world.

It was interesting to learn about different fructification processes of the mycelium. Learning from substrates, different species and conditions. At the end of the session, we dedicated some time to take part on the \u201cMycelium Liberation Front\u201d, which aim is to \u201cliberate\u201d lab experiments in the natural ecosystem. </p> <p>I decided to bring with me one of my mycelium-clay experiments that I developed for the design dialogues as a medium to discuss about mycelium practices, deepen knowledge on this specific technique (mycelium growing on and in clay) and its possible future to create structures that are able to fructify, and at the end of the workshop, to liberate it in the nearest green area. </p> <p>After presenting the experiment and ask questions the conversation was triggered, and I could learn from the Enclave Micopirata Mutante that clay minerals have been proved to have antimicrobial and antifungal properties, unless it has sufficient nutrients to enable fungal growth. We talked about several recipes that could be fructifying in clay as well as techniques to enable respiration in the clay body.  We talked about clay and ceramics. How the process of working with one or another is relevant in order to define one\u2019s relationship with the material, or the living organism in the case of mycelium.</p> <p>Another que I had was to know their perspective on using mycelium as a material. Some people are against of this approach as it is seen as manipulating a living being in order to kill it and produce a polymer that serve humans. The question triggered a long and interesting conversation with different points of view:</p> <ul> <li> <p>For some of the participants it is okay to work with mycelium as a material depending on the end use. It is more ethically correct to use it as a plastic substitute or animal leather substitute, rather than for other proposes. This also made us think on how we view eating animals and using wood as a material, which to me personally is something similar, as we grow plants in order to use their wood and fibers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Made us think on how working with mycelium in the lab, involves the use of lots of plastics from gloves to petri dishes, plastic bags, boxes and foil. At the end the expression of \u201cit is okay to use it as a plastic substitute\u201d becomes contradictory with the laboratory process.</p> </li> <li> <p>Depends on the relationship one has with mycelium. If it is a reciprocal relationship, where one gives nutrients in order to receive something, especially better if its food (mushrooms) rather than a material. </p> </li> <li> <p>At the end, the conversation made us question where does the human manipulation start, or where does it become damaging for the organism.</p> </li> <li> <p>Is it okay to work with it in a laboratory, controlling its conditions and development as long as the end use is not to obtain a material? Is it okay to do this as long as we tackle the plastic problem or for food production? Can mycelium become a \u201cmaterial giver\u201d such as trees and other plants with wood and fibers? How can mycelium cultivation and harvesting become more \u201crespectful\u201d? How can human and fungal relationship can be deepened?  I extrapolate it with my clay practice in order to create ceramic pieces, where I am conscious of the material origin, the time it takes to process to be useful for modeling a piece, the physical contact and manipulation with my body, the process to wood fire it.

We find ourselves reliant on outdated systems that have ceased to function effectively. As we embrace the need for transformation, flexibility, adaptability, and renewal, we stand on the brink of a new era</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"term3/01-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#reflections","title":"Reflections","text":"<p>It was interesting to think about these new signals, which are essentially new trends, in this case, focused on possible futures and shifts that are occurring in systems and ways of living. For this exercise, Anthuanet and I partnered together because we have several common themes. We are both interested in bioprocesses, and how these new ways of interacting with natural agents allow us to expand our understanding of other non-human intelligences and the functioning of systems involving agents such as the sun, wind, and the water cycle on the planet. At the same time, thanks to our work with microorganisms and compost, we see this vision of matter transformation, discussing how death gives life to new systems. We see this as a philosophy of life that can be applied in multiple layers. I consider that the exercise has a structure that guides and helps understand step by step the identification of these new trends. I consider the openness of the exercise important to allow each person to contribute with their topic of interest and greater knowledge. At the same time, this also allows the combination of ideas and the formulation of weak signals with more depth and a more interdisciplinary approach.</p> <p>Identifying weak signals can help focus our interests on certain topics that represent opportunities for intervention and change. Making it collaborative makes it even more interesting because you can understand the thought process of other disciplines and also allow yourself to be influenced by them, changing your perspective to a more holistic and better-supported one.</p>"}]}
